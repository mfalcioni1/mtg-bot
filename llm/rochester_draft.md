What is Rochester Draft?
Rochester Draft is a drafting format where players take turns selecting cards from booster packs in a public and organized manner. Unlike other draft formats like Booster Draft, all players can see the cards being picked and passed, which adds a strategic layer of open information and interaction.

Setup
Players:

Typically played with 6-8 players.
Everyone sits in a circle to facilitate draft order.
Packs:

Each player starts with a set number of booster packs (usually 3).
Each booster pack contains 15 cards.
Draft Process
Opening a Pack:

The first player opens a booster pack and lays out all 15 cards face up on the table for everyone to see.
First Pick:

The player who opened the pack selects the first card.
Snaking Order:

Drafting proceeds clockwise around the table, with each player taking one card from the pack.
When the last player takes their card, the draft reverses direction (counterclockwise) for the next round of picks.
This "snaking" continues until all cards from the pack are selected.
Next Pack:

The next player in clockwise order opens the next booster pack and repeats the process.
The starting picker rotates for each new pack.
Key Rules
Open Information: All players see every card picked. You’ll need to strategize based on what others are drafting.
No Random Passing: Packs don’t get passed around; all cards are visible on the table, and picks are made in turn.
Build a Deck: After drafting, each player builds a 40-card deck (including lands) using the cards they drafted. You can add as many basic lands as you need.
